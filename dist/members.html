Toastmasters helped by giving me an environment to learn, try and fail safely. The positive feedback mechanisms built into the program help without causing me to feel badly about my speech. If you need to build your confidence or learn better methods then I would encourage you to give Toastmasters an honest try.</p><details><summary>Contact Info</summary><div>Phone:</div><div>Email:</div><div>Social Media links:</div></details></div></div><div class="media p-3 mt-5"><img src="../assets/images/members/charlie.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-member order-sm-last"><div class="media-body px-3"><h1 class="name">Charlie Monette</h1><div role="doc-subtitle" class="mb-4">Vice President of Education</div><p class="jumbotron">A retired electrical engineer and professional flight instructor living in Versailles.

I first came here to get my boss off my back. I stayed when I realized how much fun I was having. Then I discovered the leadership side of the program and I have grown so much. I have been in Toastmasters since 2004 and I love the Midway club. We have a very vibrant group of people intent on improving our communication skills and having fun.

I became a certified DreamBuilder Coach with the Life Mastery Institute, started my own business C Possibilities Coaching, LLC, joined Georgetown Chamber of Commerce, joined Midway Toastmasters, and finished a full year of being Plant Controller at Adient - Georgetown (where I have worked 24 years). Toastmasters makes me feel so welcomed and encouraged to accomplish anything that I can dream.</p></div></div><div class="media p-3 mt-5"><img src="../assets/images/members/sheri.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-member"><div class="media-body px-3"><h1 class="name">Sheri Wood</h1><div role="doc-subtitle" class="mb-4">Sergeant at Arms</div><p class="jumbotron">Sheri joined the Midway Toastmasters in October of 2014 to find her voice. Although she's always enjoyed writing, speaking in public often left her tongue-tied. Since joining the club she has competed in speech contests and served as the Vice-President of PR for several years. Sheri works as a graphic artist at The Arion Group (ArionGroup.net) and Kentucky Performance Products (KPPusa.com). She moved to Kentucky from El Paso, Texas in 1985.

That's where Toastmasters comes in. It has done that and more. I have been presented with opportunities to grow personally and professionally because of the skills I have learned in Toastmasters. It has been one of the best choices I have ever made in my life.</p></div></div><div class="media p-3 mt-5"><img src="../assets/images/members/ashley.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-member"><div class="media-body px-3"><h1 class="name">Ashley Fowler</h1><div role="doc-subtitle" class="mb-4">Member</div><p class="jumbotron">I joined Toastmasters in January 2018 as a resolution to get better at public speaking. As a research scientist, giving speeches and disseminating my research findings is an important part of the job. I am striving to improve my speech delivery in order to better engage the audience and leave them with a resonating message. Midway Toastmasters is a warm community of individuals dedicated to improvement, encouragement, and having a little fun along the way.</p></div></div><div class="media p-3 mt-5"><img src="../assets/images/members/griffin.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-member order-sm-last"><div class="media-body px-3"><h1 class="name">Griffin Lilly Jr.</h1><div role="doc-subtitle" class="mb-4">Member</div><p class="jumbotron">Did you know that public speaking is the #1 fear in the world?

I am in charge of all of the training for the company. This was a scary thought especially when my speaking skills were very shaky, literally. I was brought to Toastmasters by a trusted friend and I have loved it ever since. It is a time to have fun and improve my speaking skills at the same time!</p></div></div><div class="media p-3 mt-5"><img src="../assets/images/members/hal.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-member order-sm-last"><div class="media-body px-3"><h1 class="name">Hal McCoig</h1><div role="doc-subtitle" class="mb-4">Member</div><p class="jumbotron">Someone I particularly respected recommended Toastmasters. The warm welcome and jovial atmosphere were very appealing. It was organized AND fun. I found Toastmasters to be progressive: small meeting roles prepared me for a speaking role. Everyone was helpful and understanding, all had been where I was. Professionally I am more organized and prepared with less effort, and contribute more. Socially I'm more at ease and engaged. Invest even six months as a Toastmaster and you'll never be the same.</p></div></div><div class="media p-3 mt-5"><img src="../assets/images/members/megan.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive img-member"><div class="media-body px-3"><h1 class="name">Megan Hurley</h1><div role="doc-subtitle" class="mb-4">Member</div><p class="jumbotron">Megan Hurley is a Traumatic Brain Injury survivor of 12 years & a Zumba Fitness instructor.
