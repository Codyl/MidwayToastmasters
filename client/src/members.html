              My career had me making technical presentations for companies
              nationwide. Toastmasters helped by giving me an environment to
              learn, try and fail safely. The positive feedback mechanisms built
              into the program help without causing me to feel badly about my
              speech. If you need to build your confidence or learn better
              methods then I would encourage you to give Toastmasters an honest
              try.

              I can't say enough about the Toastmasters program. I first came
              here to get my boss off my back. I stayed when I realized how much
              fun I was having. Then I discovered the leadership side of the
              program and I have grown so much. I have been in Toastmasters
              since 2004 and I love the Midway club. We have a very vibrant
              group of people intent on improving our communication skills and
              having fun. If you're looking for a regular opportunity to improve

              I joined Toastmasters because I needed to learn how to network and
              give speeches that inspire others. 2019 was a year of change for
              me (with constantly stepping out of my comfort zone). I became a
              certified DreamBuilder Coach with the Life Mastery Institute,
              started my own business C Possibilities Coaching, LLC, joined
              Georgetown Chamber of Commerce, joined Midway Toastmasters, and
              finished a full year of being Plant Controller at Adient -
              Georgetown (where I have worked 24 years). Toastmasters makes me
              feel so welcomed and encouraged to accomplish anything that I can
              dream.

              competed in speech contests and served as the Vice-President of PR
              for several years. Sheri works as a graphic artist at The Arion

              speeches and disseminating my research findings is an important
              part of the job. I am striving to improve my speech delivery in

              Someone I particularly respected recommended Toastmasters. The
              warm welcome and jovial atmosphere were very appealing. It was
              organized AND fun. I found Toastmasters to be progressive: small
              meeting roles prepared me for a speaking role. Everyone was
              helpful and understanding, all had been where I was.
              Professionally I am more organized and prepared with less effort,
              and contribute more. Socially I'm more at ease and engaged. Invest
              even six months as a Toastmaster and you'll never be the same.
